# Day 10 


**Simple Neural Network from Scratch in Python**

---

## About This Project

Today marks my 10th day in a 60-day learning journey, and I’m excited to share what I’ve been working on! I’m building a simple neural network entirely from scratch using Python — no deep learning frameworks, just pure numpy and basic concepts.

This project demonstrates the fundamental steps in training a neural network:
- Creating a dataset for a simple addition problem
- Initializing weights (parameters) manually
- Implementing the forward pass (calculating output)
- Using gradient descent for training weights
- Visualizing training error and weights evolution
- Testing the accuracy on unseen data

---

## Features

- Randomly generate datasets for the problem of adding two numbers.
- Initialize and update weights either randomly or manually.
- Train the network using gradient descent and observe how error decreases over iterations.
- View plots of error vs iterations and how each weight evolves during training.
- Evaluate accuracy on a test set.

## How to Run

This project uses **Streamlit** for the interactive UI.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, streamlit

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib streamlit
