# AutoGen Chatbot Tutorial ‚Äì Day 13

This tutorial walks through the basic steps of creating a chatbot using the [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) framework. The tutorial is broken down into six Python scripts, each building on the previous one. This project is part of a hands-on learning journey and marks **Day 13** of my exploration into AutoGen.
