# ðŸš€ Day 6

Welcome to **Day 6** of my *60 Days of Learning* journey!

---

## ðŸ“… Overview

This week, Iâ€™m exploring the fields of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** . Today, I will work with a focus on their applications in **robotics**.

Todayâ€™s objective was to integrate **OpenCV** into a robotics simulation system to enable intelligent behavior using computer vision.

## ðŸ¤– Project: Multi-Robot Target Detection

### Goal:
To develop a **multi-robot simulation system** where robots autonomously explore an environment and detect a specific target using a trained AI model.

### Approach:
- Utilized **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time object detection.
- Trained a **custom YOLO model** on my dataset to detect a specific target.
- Integrated the trained model into an OpenCV pipeline.
- Designed robots to navigate and detect targets in a simulated environment.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 (Custom Trained)
- Robotics Simulation (e.g., Gazebo or custom setup)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements

- Successfully trained a custom YOLO model for target recognition.
- Implemented object detection using OpenCV and YOLO.
- Set up initial logic for a multi-robot exploration strategy.
- Created a working prototype for collaborative target search.
