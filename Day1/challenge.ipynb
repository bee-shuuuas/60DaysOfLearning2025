    "Each of our cakes has three attributes that we need to store:  \n",
    "- what kind of cake it is (kind),  \n",
    "- the price, and  \n",
    "- how many slices a full cake contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need each of our cake instances to return a string describing themselves in the format:  \n",

    "- Create a class called `Cake` with attributes `kind`, `price`, and `slices`.\n",
    "- Create a method in the class called `describe()` that returns a string formatted like the example above.\n",
