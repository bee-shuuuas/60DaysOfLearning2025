# Day 2 â€“ DSA

The main aim of my series is to learn and build some ML projects.  
Today, on **Day 2**, I focused on revisiting **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** concepts.

I had studied DSA about a month ago and kept both my **notes and code** organized.  
Today, I went through my old material and revised the following topics:

- Linked List (Singly and Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Table
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Recursion
